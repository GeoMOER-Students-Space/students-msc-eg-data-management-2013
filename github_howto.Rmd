GitHub Howto
========================================================

The easiest way to work with GitHub from within RStudio is to add an existing
repository as a project. Therefore you first create your git repository using
a shell or using the interactive buttons at GitHub. Afterwards you create a
new project from an existing directory (Menue: Project - Create project).
