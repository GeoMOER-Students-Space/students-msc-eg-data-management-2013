GitHub Howto
========================================================

The easiest way to work with GitHub from within RStudio is to add an existing
repository as a project. Therefore you first create your local git repository
using a shell or create an online repository using the shell, the interactive
buttons at GitHub or maybe the GitHub Windows program. Afterwards you create a
new project from an existing directory (Menue: Project - Create project).


After changing, adding, deleting files within the repository, use the tab in the
upper right window called "Git" to prepare the local commit. Check the boxes
next to all files which indicate some modification. Afterwards, press commit.
You will now have a chance to include a documentation for the commit.

Once the local commit has successfully been executed, you can push the
repository to GitHub using the push arrow. The Git tab won't show any content
as long as the local repository is not modified.
